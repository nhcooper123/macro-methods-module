# Macro Methods Module 2016-2019

A more up-to-date version of these materials exists from 2020 onwards. This is maintained as a legacy repo.

This repository contains the course materials for my Masters level module on methods in macroecology and macroevolution. It is mainly focussed on phylogenetic comparative methods in R.

The link to the HTML version of the course book is [here](https://nhcooper123.github.io/macro-methods-module/).
